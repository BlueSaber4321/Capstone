Submitted a skills document last week to prepare for selecting my project. This week I met with Professor Braverman and explained what kind of skills I would like to include in my project. Told him that I would like to go into mainly computer management in managing multiple devices and dealing with hardware such as desktops and servers (such as computer labs). Wanted to also do some Networking like CET 249, 349, and 449. Did not want to get to involved in CyberSecurity, but more or less building a network and not dealing with security of such network and would go into it if needed. Professor Braverman asked if I could brainstorm some ideas as to what I should place on the document before we select my actual project for the next 6 months.
